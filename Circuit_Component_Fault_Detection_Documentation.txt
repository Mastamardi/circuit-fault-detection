================================================================================
                              2. PROBLEM DEFINITION
================================================================================

2.1 PROBLEM STATEMENT

The electronics manufacturing industry is experiencing unprecedented challenges in 
maintaining quality control and detecting faults in circuit boards, with the global 
PCB market valued at USD 72.3 billion in 2022 and projected to grow at a CAGR of 
4.3% through 2030. Traditional fault detection systems rely heavily on manual 
visual inspection, basic automated optical inspection (AOI) systems, and 
conventional electrical testing methods, which are increasingly inadequate for 
modern manufacturing demands.

Current systems face critical limitations including high false positive rates of 
up to 25%, limited ability to process large volumes of inspection data, inability 
to handle real-time data streams from multiple sources, lack of predictive 
capabilities for potential faults, and poor integration with other manufacturing 
systems. These limitations result in increased production costs, longer inspection 
times, reduced quality control efficiency, and higher rates of defective products 
reaching the market.

The complexity of modern electronic components, increasing production volumes, and 
the need for real-time quality control have created an urgent need for advanced 
analytics solutions that can process large datasets, detect patterns, and provide 
predictive insights for fault prevention. Manual inspection processes are not only 
time-consuming but also prone to human error, while existing automated systems 
lack the sophistication to handle the multi-dimensional nature of circuit board 
sensor data.

Furthermore, the lack of integration between different quality control systems 
leads to fragmented data and missed opportunities for comprehensive analysis. 
Manufacturers need a unified platform that can aggregate data from multiple 
sources, apply advanced analytics, and provide actionable insights for both 
immediate fault detection and long-term quality improvement strategies.

The fundamental problem is the absence of a comprehensive, scalable, and 
intelligent fault detection system that can leverage big data technologies to 
process large volumes of sensor data, detect anomalies, predict potential faults, 
and provide real-time monitoring capabilities for quality control in electronics 
manufacturing.

2.2 LITERATURE REVIEW

Recent advances in big data analytics and machine learning have opened new 
possibilities for fault detection in manufacturing systems. Several researchers 
have explored the application of distributed computing frameworks for processing 
large-scale sensor data. Zhang et al. (2021) demonstrated the effectiveness of 
Apache Spark in processing real-time sensor data for industrial IoT applications, 
achieving 40% improvement in processing speed compared to traditional batch 
processing methods. Their work established the foundation for using distributed 
computing in manufacturing analytics.

The application of MapReduce algorithms for fault detection has been extensively 
studied by Kumar and Patel (2022), who developed a custom MapReduce implementation 
for analyzing electronic component data. Their approach showed significant 
improvements in fault detection accuracy, with a 35% reduction in false positive 
rates compared to conventional statistical methods. The study highlighted the 
importance of distributed processing for handling large datasets in real-time 
manufacturing environments.

Machine learning approaches for predictive maintenance have gained considerable 
attention in recent years. Li et al. (2023) proposed a deep learning framework 
for fault prediction in electronic components using sensor data, achieving 85% 
accuracy in predicting component failures 24 hours in advance. Their work 
demonstrated the potential of combining multiple sensor readings (voltage, 
current, temperature) for comprehensive fault analysis.

The integration of web-based dashboards for real-time monitoring has been explored 
by several researchers. Wang and Chen (2022) developed a Flask-based dashboard for 
industrial process monitoring, emphasizing the importance of user-friendly 
interfaces for quality control personnel. Their system provided real-time 
visualizations and alert mechanisms, significantly improving response times to 
quality issues.

Anomaly detection in manufacturing systems has been a focus area for many 
researchers. Johnson et al. (2023) proposed a statistical approach for detecting 
anomalies in circuit board sensor data using threshold-based methods and 
correlation analysis. Their work showed that combining multiple sensor parameters 
improved anomaly detection accuracy by 45% compared to single-parameter analysis.

The application of big data technologies in electronics manufacturing has been 
studied by several industry reports. A 2023 study by the Electronics Manufacturing 
Association found that companies implementing big data analytics solutions 
experienced an average 30% reduction in quality-related costs and 25% improvement 
in production efficiency. The study emphasized the importance of real-time 
processing capabilities and predictive analytics for modern manufacturing.

Recent developments in Apache Spark for real-time analytics have been documented 
by the Apache Software Foundation (2023), highlighting improvements in streaming 
capabilities and machine learning integration. These developments have made Spark 
an increasingly attractive option for manufacturing analytics applications.

The integration of multiple data sources for comprehensive analysis has been 
explored by Rodriguez and Martinez (2023), who developed a data fusion framework 
for combining sensor data, historical records, and environmental factors. Their 
approach showed improved fault detection accuracy and better understanding of 
failure patterns.
