Temperature (C) was used as the primary metric for measuring heat in the circuit board components. The raw temperature readings from sensors were grouped by temperature_category to analyze average thermal conditions. No additional smoothing or noise filtering was applied in this analysis, but such preprocessing can be incorporated if sensor noise is detected in future iterations. The average temperature per category provides insight into thermal stress and operational safety of components.
