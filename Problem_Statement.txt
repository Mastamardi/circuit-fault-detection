Circuit Component Fault Detection Dashboard

In the rapidly evolving landscape of electronics and embedded systems, circuit boards form the backbone of countless devices, from consumer electronics to industrial automation systems. The reliability and safety of these devices are critically dependent on the health and performance of their circuit components. However, as circuit boards become increasingly complex and densely packed, the risk of component faults, overheating, and unexpected failures rises significantly. Traditional manual inspection and basic monitoring techniques are no longer sufficient to ensure early detection and prevention of faults in such intricate systems.

Modern circuit boards are equipped with a variety of sensors that continuously monitor parameters such as voltage, current, temperature, and power consumption. Despite the availability of this rich sensor data, organizations often struggle to process and analyze the vast volumes of information generated in real time. This challenge is further compounded by the need to identify subtle patterns, anomalies, and correlations that may indicate the onset of faults or performance degradation. Delayed or missed detection of such issues can lead to costly downtime, equipment damage, safety hazards, and loss of productivity.

To address these challenges, there is a pressing need for an intelligent, scalable, and automated solution that leverages big data processing techniques to analyze circuit board sensor data. Such a solution should be capable of efficiently handling large datasets, performing advanced analytics, and providing actionable insights for timely fault detection and predictive maintenance.

Problem Statement: The project aims to develop a comprehensive dashboard that utilizes big data technologies (MapReduce and Spark) to analyze circuit board sensor data, enabling early detection of component faults, visualization of key metrics, and support for predictive maintenance in complex electronic systems.

Extra: Expanded 3.2 Pre-processing Techniques Applied

To ensure the reliability and analytical value of the collected circuit board sensor data, a series of essential pre-processing steps are performed:

- **Missing Value Handling:**
  - Short gaps in sensor readings (e.g., due to brief disconnections) are filled using linear interpolation or forward fill methods.
  - Longer or critical gaps are flagged for review to avoid introducing bias.
  - Duplicate timestamps are removed to maintain time-series integrity.

- **Noise Reduction:**
  - Moving average and median filters are applied to smooth out random fluctuations and remove transient spikes in the data.
  - For particularly noisy signals, additional smoothing (such as Savitzky-Golay filtering) may be used.

- **Outlier Detection and Removal:**
  - Data points that fall outside expected operational ranges (based on domain knowledge or statistical thresholds) are identified as outliers.
  - Outliers are either removed or replaced with more representative values to prevent skewing analysis results.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - New features are derived from raw data, such as calculating power (P = V × I), rate of change, and rolling averages over different time windows.
  - Temporal features (e.g., time of day, day of week) are extracted to support trend and anomaly analysis.

- **Normalization and Scaling:**
  - Sensor readings are normalized (e.g., min-max scaling or z-score normalization) to ensure comparability across different features and components.
  - Categorical variables (such as fault type or component type) are encoded using one-hot or label encoding as needed for analysis.

- **Aggregation:**
  - Data is aggregated at different time intervals (minute, hour, day) to support both real-time and historical analysis.
  - Component-level and system-level summaries are generated for dashboard visualization and reporting.

These pre-processing steps collectively enhance data quality, reduce noise and inconsistencies, and ensure that the dataset is well-structured for downstream analytics, fault detection, and visualization in the dashboard.

4.1 Design of Map Reduce Task for the Problem

The MapReduce paradigm is leveraged in this project to efficiently process large-scale circuit board sensor data for fault detection and analysis. The design of the MapReduce task is structured to handle distributed computation, enabling scalable and parallel processing of time-series sensor data from multiple circuit components.

**Map Phase:**
- Each mapper processes a subset of the input CSV data, reading records line by line.
- For each record, the mapper extracts key features such as component ID, timestamp, voltage, current, temperature, and fault status.
- The mapper emits key-value pairs where the key is typically the component ID (or a composite key of component ID and time window), and the value is a tuple of relevant sensor readings and fault indicators.

**Shuffle and Sort Phase:**
- The MapReduce framework automatically groups all values by their keys, ensuring that all data for a given component (or time window) is sent to the same reducer.

**Reduce Phase:**
- Each reducer receives all records for a specific component or group.
- The reducer aggregates sensor readings to compute statistics such as average voltage, current, temperature, and total power consumption.
- Fault counts and fault rates are calculated for each component.
- The reducer can also identify time periods with abnormal readings or frequent faults, supporting further analysis.
- The final output is a summary for each component, including aggregated metrics and fault statistics, which is written to an output CSV file for visualization and reporting.

This MapReduce design enables the system to efficiently process and analyze massive datasets, providing timely insights into circuit component health and supporting predictive maintenance strategies.
